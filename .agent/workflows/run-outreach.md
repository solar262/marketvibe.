description: How to run the MarketVibe Outreach Agent
---

To find new leads and generate outreach drafts, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project folder (if not already there).
3. Run the following command:
```powershell
node outreach_agent.mjs
```

### 🎯 What happens next:
- The script will search for entrepreneurs based on your keywords.
- It will generate a data-driven "Teaser Report" for each lead.
- It will output a ready-to-copy reply that you can use on Twitter or Reddit.
