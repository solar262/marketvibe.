## 📣 The Maker Message (First Comment)
*Copy and paste this as the first comment on your Product Hunt post to build immediate trust.*

"Hey Product Hunt! 👋 

I'm the creator of MarketVibe. Over the last year, I saw too many founders get stuck in the 'Idea Loop'—spending months building products that nobody actually asked for. 

I built MarketVibe to be the autonomous partner I wish I had. It doesn't just give you AI 'ideas'; it hunts for real buying intent on Reddit and X, builds your revenue models, and gives you a 30-day playbook to get to $1k/mo.

We’re live today with the 'Authority Engine' update, which helps you build viral loops and AEO citations from day one. I’ll be here all day to answer your questions and help you validate your ideas! 🚀"
